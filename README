xvsr10 is a codename for xUnit.net test runner package for VisualStudio 2010.

It was originally created by EmperorXLII and published as a work item
under http://xunit.codeplex.com/workitem/5648, however the xUnit team
was not able to mantain nor support it, as they put their effort into
their own runner for VisualStudio 2011.

This repository hosts the original work of EmperorXLII, it's added as
the first revision. It was then upgraded to integrate more seamlessly
with the VS2010 environment.

Please note, that this project REQUIRES a patched version of Executor
Wrapper class normally included in xunit.utility.runner.dll, as the
current (2012-04-01, no joke) version contains a bug that interferes
with VisualStudio message transporting services. A patch against this
bug was posted to the xUnit (http://xunit.codeplex.com/workitem/9780)
and awaits attention:) Until it is incorporated (if ever), you have
to either patch it yourself, or use the version supplied in "imports"

Moreover, most notes of the original author are still applicable:

1)
> To be clear, this is BETA QUALITY at best. It is able to run all
> xUnit Fact and Theory tests, display results just like MSUnit
> data-driven tests, and is compatible with VS's Code Coverage feature
> (and likely others).

2)
> There are some caveats (below). If these are acceptable, feel free
> to use the extension or code as you see fit. The extension can be
> installed by running the install.bat file in the Exports directory.

3)
> Please see the NUnitForVS page for how to update existing projects
> to show up as test projects in VS (the ProjectTypeGuids section).

4)
> Known issues:
> - Methods in a class must have a unique name (i.e. you cannot have
> multiple Theory methods with the same name but different arguments).

Briefly, the process of updating projects mentioned in (3) is:

> Add a following tag in the first <PropertyGroup> tag in the .csproj,
> you may also edit existing 'ProjectTypeGuids' element and insert
> those keys there. Remember to reload/reopen the projects afterwards.
> C#
>     <ProjectTypeGuids>
>         {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};
>         {FAE04EC0-301F-11D3-BF4B-00C04F79EFBC}
>     </ProjectTypeGuids>
> Visual Basic version:
>     <ProjectTypeGuids>
>         {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};
>         {F184B08F-C81C-45F6-A57F-5ABD9991F28F}
>     </ProjectTypeGuids>

Please also note that the GUIDs identifying the original version
are mostly taken from some SDK sample projects, and in the later
commits they have been changed. Please uninstall any old versions of
this package before installing current one.
