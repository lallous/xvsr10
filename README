xvsr10 is a codename for xUnit.net test runner package for VisualStudio 2010.

BACKGROUND

It was originally created by EmperorXLII and published as a work item
under http://xunit.codeplex.com/workitem/5648, however the xUnit team
was not able to mantain nor support it, as they put their effort into
their own runner for VisualStudio 2011.

This repository hosts the original work of EmperorXLII, it's added as
the first revision. It was then upgraded to integrate more seamlessly
with the VS2010 environment.

NOTES for v2.1

Most notes of the original author are still applicable:

1)
> To be clear, this is BETA QUALITY at best. It is able to run all
> xUnit Fact and Theory tests, display results just like MSUnit
> data-driven tests, and is compatible with VS's Code Coverage feature
> (and likely others).

2)
> There are some caveats (below). If these are acceptable, feel free
> to use the extension or code as you see fit. The extension can be
> installed by running the install.bat file in the Exports directory.

3) [obsolete note, see below]

4)
> Known issues:
> - Methods in a class must have a unique name (i.e. you cannot have
> multiple Theory methods with the same name but different arguments).

INSTALLATION

All the fuss about .bat, .reg and similar files is now gone!

Just download the package and install by double-clicking the VSIX file.
On the first run, the runner will probably show a message asking you to
complete the installation. Confirm it, accept the UAC propmpt if any,
and install the correct patches using the utility that will show up.
It should be as easy as clicking two buttons ('update' then 'close').

REQUIREMENTS:

Of course, a xUnit library is needed. You dont have to install it in
any special place. Just "Add reference" to it and write tests as usual,
and the runner will have no problems with finding it when needed. 

HOWEVER:

Please note, that this project REQUIRES a patched version of Executor
Wrapper class normally included in xunit.utility.runner.dll, as the
current (2012-04-01, no joke) version contains a bug that interferes
with VisualStudio message transporting services. A patch against this
bug was posted to the xUnit (http://xunit.codeplex.com/workitem/9780)
and awaits attention:) Until it is incorporated (if ever), you have
to either patch it yourself, or use the version supplied in "imports"

NOTES ON USAGE:

Remember that tests ideally should reside in a separate project, of the
'Test Project' type. The default reasoning is that the test code should
not clutter the original module. This xUnit runner is built upon builtin
test runner and it adheres to that rule: you will not see item templates
nor all the handy buttons/toolbars/commands unless the tests are in some
'Test Project'. Simply add a new project of that type to the solution,
move your tests there and have fun.

If for some reason you really don't want to create a separate project
for keeping and running the tests, you can DESIGNATE ANY normal project
to be also a test project: right click on it in the Solution Explorer
and choose "Enable test extensions" (xvsr10 bonus thingy). You may have
to unload and reload the project afterwards. After doing so, that project
should be recognized as a test project and the runner should work properly
with tests from it. If you have clicked it and then changed your mind,
simply "Disable test extensions" in a similar way.

Another addon you may find useful is 'Shutdown QTAgent' from Tests main
menu. It can be irritating that the runner currently does not support
stopping and pausing tests, especially if you manage somehow to deadlock
or starve the test process. You can simply kill the QTAgent with TaskManager,
but I find that 'Shutdown QTAgent' option quicker and more handy.

UNINSTALLATION:

Uninstalling via Extension Manager is NOT ENOUGH. If you are going to
uninstall the runner, then FIRST use the 'xUnit runner manager' from
'Tests' menu and uninstall all patches (three clicks: "all:uninstall",
'update' then 'close'), and only then uninstall the runner extension.

If you happen to accidentially 'just uninstall' from the extension
manager - do not worry. It is safe to leave the tiny junk behind, it
should not interfere with anything. In case you want to fix/tidy it:
- you may reinstall the VSIX and use the 'xUnit runner manager' properly
- or, you may go to Common7/IDE/PrivateAssemblies in your VisualStudio
installation and delete the xunit runner's directory by hand.
